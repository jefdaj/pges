Tuesday is a 4th year graduate student in the Plant and Microbial Biology (PMB)
department at UC Berkeley. She is co-advised by Devin Coleman-Derr and Adam
Arkin, and her studies focus on how endophytic bacterial communities change
during drought stress. Working primarily on sorghum, a drought-tolerant grain,
Tuesday is investigating the mechanisms that are responsible for a shift toward
a monoderm-dominant microbiome, as well as the effect that community change has
on the host plant. Part of this work involves designing and applying synthetic
bacterial communities with the goal of enhancing plant growth during drought
stress.
