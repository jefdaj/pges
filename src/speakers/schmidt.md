Monica Schmidt is an Associate Professor in the School of Plant Sciences in the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences and the BIO5 Institute at the University of Arizona. She received a PhD in Genetics from the University of British Columbia and completed post-doctoral positions at University of Georgia and USDA at the Danforth Plant Science Center. Dr. Schmidtâ€™s research interests are in both functional foods and functional genomics. Her research aims at applying molecular biology and genetic techniques to help alleviate current major agricultural problems. As soybean is a global commodity, much of her research focuses on soybean seed traits. Current research is investigating cellular mechanisms to strengthen the metabolic engineering efforts to fortify crops with nutraceutical carotenoids. Since soybean oil is a large component of the American diet, Dr. Schmidt is also investigating means to engineer a more healthy oil composition. Other functional food projects aim at the suppression of deleterious compounds in crops, such as toxins produced from contaminating fungus, in maize and peanuts. She uses techniques of plant biotechnology to also investigate gene function, at a cellular and entire plant level.
