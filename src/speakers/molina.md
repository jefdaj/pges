Santiago J. Molina is a PhD Candidate in the Department of Sociology at UC
Berkeley and has a designated emphasis in Science, Technology and Society. He
got his B.A. in History, Philosophy and Social Studies of Science and Medicine
at the University of Chicago. His research generally focuses on the development
of standards of practice and classification in scientific organizations. His MA
compared the International Biological Programme (1960-1970) and the 1000
Genomes Project (2008-present) to study how scientists assign biological
meaning to racial, ethnic, and national categories. His dissertation explores
how the practice of modifying human DNA with genome editing technologies is
becoming institutionalized. To do this work he has been a part of two labs at
the Innovative Genomics Institutions as the “Resident Sociologist”, conducting
participant observation and interviewing with graduate students, PIs,
regulators, and physicians. He teaches courses on sociology of illness,
medicine and the relationship between genetics and society.
