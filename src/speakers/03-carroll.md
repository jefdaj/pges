Dana Carroll, PhD, is a Distinguished Professor in the Department of
Biochemistry at the University of Utah School of Medicine and a member of the
Nuclear Control of Cell Growth and Differentiation Program at the Huntsman
Cancer Institute.

Carrolls research involves making specific changes in chromosomal DNA using
targetable nucleases. His lab pioneered the development of zinc-finger
nucleases as gene targeting tools, and they have continued working with the
more recent TALENs and CRISPR/Cas nucleases. Much of the effort has been
focused on optimizing the efficiency of these reagents for targeted mutagenesis
and gene replacement, which could ultimately provide treatment for many
diseases, including certain types of cancer. This technology has now been
applied to more than 40 different organisms, including current clinical trials
in humans.

Carroll received his bachelors degree from Swarthmore College, Pennsylvania,
and his PhD from the University of California, Berkeley. He did postdoctoral
research at the Beatson Institute for Cancer Research in Glasgow, Scotland, at
the Carnegie Institution Department of Embryology in Baltimore.
