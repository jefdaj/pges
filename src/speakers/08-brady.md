Siobhan Brady is an associate professor at UC Davis in the Department of Plant
Biology and is affiliated with the Genome Center. She is a member of the
American Society of Plant Biology and the Society of Developmental Biology. Her
lab studies the root of the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, which is ideally
suited to understand the molecular processes that underlie how and when cells
determine their identity. These features in combination with various genomic
tools are used to map the network of interactions that turn on or off gene
expression in individual tissues.

Brady received her bachelor\'s degree and PhD from the University of
Toronto. She then did postdoctoral research at Duke University where she
received the NSERC Postdoctoral Fellow Award.
