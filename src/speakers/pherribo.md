Gordon Pherribo received his B.S. in Biological Sciences from Carnegie Mellon
University and is currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Plant &
Microbial Biology. He developed a synthetic co-culture to investigate the role
of bacteriophage on nutrient sharing in microbial communities. To gain
additional insight into how the processes of scientific production are related
to the scientific product itself, his dissertation explores how life science
doctoral students construct their scientific identities in response to
departmental social practices and values. As a Center for Society, Technology
and Policy Fellow, Pherribo studied expert decision making around genetic
technologies, and has designed course curriculum that critically engages
students in the social factors impacting how science is taught, learned and
practiced.
