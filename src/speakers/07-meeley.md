Bob Meeley is a Senior Research Manager at DuPont Pioneer. Meeley\'s major
opportunities as a maize geneticist have been about collaborating broadly to
match genes with traits.  Meeley has ~25 years DuPont-Pioneer experience, and
has lead research teams as large as 50 scientists and staff; he currently leads
~15 discovery scientists and staff as part of the Genome Edited Trait Discovery
Group, based in Johnston, IA.  Integrated approaches used in these
collaborations directly apply genetic principles toward field, lab, greenhouse,
and data mining experiments for gene discovery and phenotypic validation.
Trait targets include disease tolerance and yield components and genome editing
for product development (waxy, disease, and yield regulatory \"roadmapping\"
projects).

Meeley received bachelor degrees in biology and chemistry at Hartwick College.
He received his PhD at Michigan State University.
