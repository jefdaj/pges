Markita Landry is an assistant professor in the department of Chemical and
Biomolecular Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley.  She
received a B\.S\. in Chemistry, and a B\.A\. in Physics from the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, a Ph\.D\. in Chemical Physics from the University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and completed a postdoctoral fellowship in
Chemical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Additionally, she has held interim research positions at the Biophysics
Institute at the Technical University of Munich, and at the center for
nanobiosciences at Osaka University.

Her current research centers on the development of synthetic
nanoparticle-polymer conjugates for imaging neuromodulation in the brain, and
for the delivery of functional biomolecules and nutrients into plants. The
Landry lab exploits the highly tunable chemical and physical properties of
nanomaterials for the creation of bio-mimetic structures, molecular imaging,
and gene editing. She is a recent recipient of early career awards from the
Brain and Behavior Research Foundation, the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, The
Parkinson\'s Disease Foundation, the Beckman Young Investigator program, is a
Sloan Research Fellow, an FFAR New Innovator, and is a Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub
Investigator.
