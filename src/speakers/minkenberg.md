Dr. Minkenberg is a postdoctoral scholar in the Innovative Genomics Instituteâ€™s
agricultural genomics branch. He started working on genome-editing in the food
staple rice during his time as a Beachell-Borlaug International Scholar at Penn
State. He now continues his efforts to improve disease resistance and yield of
crops at UC Berkeley under supervision of Drs. Jennifer Doudna and Brian
Staskawicz. Dr. Minkenberg's research focuses on precise genome-editing in
crops and accelerated plant breeding using advanced plant tissue culture and
CRISPR methods.
