John received his PhD in biomathematics from UCLA in 2008 writing his
dissertation on the use of GM mosquitoes to control malaria transmission. Prior
to joining UC Berkeley, he worked on several aspects of this project as a
PostDoc - social, cultural and regulatory issues at the UCLA Center for Society
& Genetics, ecological field work at the Malaria Research and Training Center
in Mali, molecular biology and population genetics at Caltech, and infectious
disease modeling and epidemiological field work at Imperial College London. At
UC Berkeley, he teaches two courses on mathematical modeling of infectious
diseases and consults on this field generally. His own research focuses on the
use of mathematical models to inform novel genetics-based strategies for
mosquito control, and to support efforts to control and eliminate
mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue and Zika virus broadly.
