Venkatesan “Sundar” Sundaresan did his undergraduate education in Physics at
the Indian Institute of Technology, his doctoral research on the genetics of
nitrogen-fixing bacteria with Fred Ausubel at Harvard University, and his
postdoctoral research on maize transposable elements with Mike Freeling at the
University of California-Berkeley. His first faculty appointment was at the
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where he and his colleagues developed methods
for genome-wide identification of gene functions in the model plant
Arabidopsis. He continued this research as the founding Director of the
Institute of Molecular Agrobiology (now the Temasek Life Sciences Laboratories)
at the National University of Singapore. Subsequently, he moved to the
University of California-Davis, and expanded his research to include rice. In
the period since, he served as Chair of the Department of Plant Biology, and as
Program Director at the National Science Foundation of BREAD, a program focused
on agricultural research to benefit developing countries. His current research
interests range from fundamental mechanisms of plant reproduction to
investigating the complexity of host-microbiome interactions.
