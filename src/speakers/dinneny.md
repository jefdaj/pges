José Dinneny received his BS from UC Berkeley in Plant Biology and Genetics in
the Department of Plant and Microbial Biology and PhD from UC San Diego working
with Detlef Weigel at the Salk Institute for Biological Science and Martin
Yanofsky in the Division of Biology, UCSD. His work focused on the cloning and
characterization of JAGGED and NUBBIN in flower and fruit development. He then
went to Duke University to do his post-doctoral studies with Philip Benfey.
There he utilized Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) to develop the
first tissue-specific map of transcriptional changes occurring during abiotic
stress. José established his independent lab at the Temasek Lifesciences
Laboratory (TLL) in Singapore with a joint appointment at the National
University of Singapore, Department of Biological Sciences. He was an inaugural
fellow of the National Research Foundation, Singapore. José moved his lab in
2011 to the Carnegie Institution for Science, Department of Plant Biology. In
2018 José joined the faculty at Stanford University in the Biology Department
as an Associate Professor.
