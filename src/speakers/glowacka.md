Katarzyna Głowacka is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biochemistry
and the Plants Science Innovation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
She completed her Ph.D. at the Institute of Plant Genetics of the Polish
Academy of Sciences (Poznań, Poland) and her postdoctoral fellowship with
feedstock genomics group at the Energy Biosciences Institute, the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) working on the genetic improvement of
biocrops. In 2013 she joined the Realizing Increased Photosynthetic Efficiency
project funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation at the Carl R. Woese
Institute for Genomic Biology at the UIUC where she worked on improving crop
productivity with the use of synthetic biology approaches. Here her research
led to a major breakthrough when faster recovery of photoprotection in
transgenic tobacco was found to increase photosynthetic efficiency and
productivity under field conditions. This work was selected in the 12 key
science moments of 2016 by the Guardian. The Głowacka laboratory focuses on the
manipulation of photosynthetic apparatus via synthetic biology approaches to
improve its function under abiotic stresses like low water availability and
chilling temperatures in crops.
