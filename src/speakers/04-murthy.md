Dr\. Niren Murthy is a professor in the Department of Bioengineering at the
University of California at Berkeley. Dr\. Murthy received his Ph\.D\. from the
University of Washington in Seattle in Bioengineering in 2001, and then did
Postdoctoral research at U.C. Berkeley in Chemistry from 2001-2003. He started
his academic career at Georgia Tech in 2003 and in 2012 moved back to U.C.
Berkeley. Dr\. Murthy\'s laboratory is an interdisciplinary laboratory that
focuses on the development of new materials for drug delivery and molecular
imaging. Murthy\'s laboratory has developed several new biomaterials and imaging
agents, such as the maltodextrin based imaging agents, which are focused on
improving the treatment and diagnosis of infectious diseases. In addition,
Murthy\'s laboratory has developed numerous reagents for detecting radical
oxidants, such as the hydrocyanines.
