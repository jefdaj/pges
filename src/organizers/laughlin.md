Organisms aerobically fixing CO~2~ through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham Cycle face
a fundamental biochemical problem: the principal enzyme, RuBisCO, has a low
affinity for CO~2~ as well as activity for the competeing and more abundant O~2~.
Some organisms utilize an integrated physiological strategy known as
a carbon-concentrating mechanism (CCM) to create elevated local concentrations
of CO~2~ around RuBisCO thus promoting on-pathway catalysis. I am interested in
structural investigation of components of bacterial CCMs with a specific focus
on membrane proteins responsible for HCO~3~ uptake. I am using cryo-electron
microscopy single-particle analysis and tomography to obtain high-resolution
structural information on these complexes, as well as in vitro assays to
examine specific aspects of their function and regulation.
