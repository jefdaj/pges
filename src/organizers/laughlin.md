Many important biological processes, such as the light-reactions of
photosynthesis, rely on multi-subunit membrane protein complexes working in
concert. Nevertheless, in many cases, the molecular basis of individual complex
function and the interaction between complexes is poorly understood. I utilize
cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to study membrane protein complexes involved
in photosynthetic electron-transport and CO~2~-uptake in cyanobacteria. To this
end, I use cryo-EM single-particle analysis to obtain high-resolution
information on purified complexes, as well as tomography to examine the
interactions between complexes in the native membrane environment. I enjoy
learning about plants and microbes that do weird things (the weirder the
better!), eating exotic foods, and satire.
