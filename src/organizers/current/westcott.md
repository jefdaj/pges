My bench work focuses on two aspects of photosynthesis. First, I\'m interested
in the organizational steps necessary for chloroplast biogenesis with a focus
on internal membrane structures. Secondly, I study how algae regulate
photosynthesis when supplemented with a variety of carbon sources. Advances in
genome editing allow me to apply and adapt new tools to new systems in the
hopes of deepening our knowledge of photosynthesis. I also work with UC
Berkeley\'s [CLEAR project](http://clear-project.org/) to inform the public
about the work of plant scientists.
