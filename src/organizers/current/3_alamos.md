Simon Álamos is a PhD candidate working jointly in the labs of Kris Niyogi and
Hernan Garcia. Simon received his  BS in Agronomy from Pontificia Universidad
Católica de Chile. He currently works on plant transcriptional activation by
developing in-vivo tools to visualize real-time transcriptional events in
response to varied stimuli. This technique allows more accurate modeling of
plant transcriptional networks.
