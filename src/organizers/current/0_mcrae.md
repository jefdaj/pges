Amanda McRae is a graduate student in the Department of Plant and Microbial
Biology at the University of California, Berkeley. Her interest in
plant-microbe interactions was sparked while studying at the University of
Arizona where she received her Bachelor of Science in Microbiology. Currently,
she is working to uncover how pathogens manipulate their host plants to provide
nutrients using the powdery mildew fungus, _Golovinomyces orontii_, and the model
plant, _Arabidopsis thaliana_.
