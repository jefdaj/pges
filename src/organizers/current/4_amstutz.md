Cynthia Amstutz is a graduate student researcher in the lab of Kris Niyogi at
the University of California, Berkeley. She is investigating photoprotection in
plants, specifically the molecular components and mechanisms involved in qH, a
sustained form of energy dissipation. By enhancing the rate of qH recovery, she
aims to improve photosynthetic efficiency. Cynthia earned her bachelor's degree
in plant biology as well as molecular genetics and genomics from Michigan State
University. She is now pursuing her doctorate in plant biology at Berkeley. Her
work has been [published][1] in The Plant Journal.
