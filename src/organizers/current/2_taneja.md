I am a postdoctoral researcher at U.C. Berkeley working on understanding
powdery mildews and their host plant interactions. A segment of this work
focuses on translational applications of this research into economically
important crops. Additionally, a personal passion of mine is working with The
Millet Project at U\.C\. Berkeley to improve awareness about these ancient grains
and their benefits to the society, while also learning to grow them myself.
During my doctoral and postdoctoral research in New Delhi, India, I had worked
on medicinal plants to improve production of bioactive compounds and to
increase disease resistance in crop plants. I have a keen interest in working
towards providing both food safety and public health improvements. In my spare
time, I enjoy music, traveling, and cooking.
