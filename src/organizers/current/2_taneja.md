I am an Assistant Project Scientist at University of California, Berkeley working on understanding powdery mildews and their host plant interactions. A segment of this work focuses on translation of this research into economically important crops.

During my doctoral and postdoctoral research in New Delhi, India, I had worked to improve production of bioactive compounds in medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus and to increase disease resistance against leaf curl virus in tomato. I have keen interest in working towards providing both food safety and public health improvements.

In my spare time, I enjoy music, traveling, cooking, and meditation.
