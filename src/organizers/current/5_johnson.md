My research focuses on identifying genes involved in the response of
photosynthesis to environmental stresses like fluctuating light. My bench work
primarily involves the cyanobacteria
[_Synechococcus_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synechococcus) and
[_Synechocystis_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synechocystis), but I also
investigate a range of green and non-green genomes for comparison. I use
[phylogenomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenomics) and [transposon
sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposon_sequencing) to identify
candidate genes, then validate them with the help of emerging tools like
[Cas9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cas9) and
[Cpf1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR/Cpf1), as well as traditional
cloning. I hope that my work will help make biofuels economically viable, increase crop
yields, and/or lead to the ability to synthesize new drugs and antibiotics
using bacteria.

I also enjoy programming, and am passionate about promoting
transparency and reproducibility through open source software and automation.
