The CRISPR-Cas system has recently emerged as a revolutionary genome editing
technology. I aim to translate this system into a novel class of plant
therapeutics to effectively control plant disease. Cassava Brown Streak Disease
(CBSD) currently represents a serious threat to food security and subsistence
agriculture for smallholder farmers in the developing world, especially in
Africa. The objective of my research is to generate durable genetic resistance
to CBSD infection in cassava. Application of this system to combat potyvirus
infections can serve as a sustainable solution to global food challenges.
