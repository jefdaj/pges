Patrick Shih is a Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation Fellow at the Joint
BioEnergy Institute and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. As a graduate
student at UC Berkeley he worked on the evolution and engineering of
photosynthesis. Currently, Patrick is developing plant synthetic biology tools
to facilitate complex engineering efforts in crop plants. These tools are being
utilized to engineer bioenergy and sustainability traits into a number of plant
species.
