Nathanael Johnson grew up in Nevada City, California, a Gold Rush town in the
Sierra foothills surrounded by rivers. He started working as a raft guide on
these rivers then traveled to Alaska to paddle there. His first job out of
college was in southern Idaho, writing for a local newspaper. The years in
Idaho brought him into daily contact with sugar beets and animal waste lagoons,
which has inspired his writing on food and farming.
 
He\'s published two books for which he received much critical praise and almost
no money. He\'s written for a bunch of fancy magazines and radio shows and won
some awards that sound more important than they really are. These days he\'s
the senior writer for the environmental magazine, Grist, and works from home
in Berkeley, California, with his wife and two daughters. He finds he can
write best by staying up later than anyone else.
